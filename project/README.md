For your second project, your task is to use the MSP430
Microcontroller and your creativity to design a toy. Each MSP430 board
is equipped with buttons, LED's, a speaker, and 4 button switches
Utilizing these features and your knowledge of I/O, develop a
program to turn the board into a toy.

This toy should at minimum:

* generate sounds,
* dynamically change the LEDs that are illuminated, both brighly and dimmly,
* implement a state machine to maintain the state of the toy,
* and use the four buttons on the expansion board (P2.0-3) to transition the state machine.

**Furthermore, at least one of the functions to transition the state machine must be written by you in assembly language.**
